# Portfolio Project 

## Description
Through past couple of years Denmark has adapted more nationalistic views in terms of foreigners, thus leading internationals to leave the country. It is a topic close to home as I am an international in Denmark and therefore am interested in whether these decisions, that drive internationals away, are the right ones in terms of workforce, kids and other. Is danish economy actually in need of internationals and their children or not?

## Main Question: 
Are current number of births and people in workforce enough to sustain Denmarkâ€™s economy and take care of elderly citizens in 5 year-period?
### Hypothesis 1: 
People have smaller families in 2021 than any other year in a 5-year period.
### Hypothesis 2: 
Due to smaller number of births, there are less people to replace the deaths in the society.
### Hypothesis 3: 
Within coming years there will be a deficit of a workforce vs retirees.
